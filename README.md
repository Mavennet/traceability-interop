# Traceability Interoperability

An enterprise grade HTTP API for leveraging [W3C Decentralized Identifiers](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and [W3C Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) with [W3C CCG Traceability Vocabulary](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-vocab/) and the [VC API](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/) when possible.

## Meetings

Meetings are held

- Tuesdays at 1.30pm ET/10.30pm PT
- on jitsi using this link: [meet.w3c-ccg.org/traceability](https://meet.w3c-ccg.org/traceability)
- with standing agenda to review open [Pull Requests](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/pulls),
  then [open Issues](https://github.com/w3c-ccg/traceability-interop/issues), unless otherwise noted on the mailing list

### Hosting instructions

Any chair, editor, or other party authorized by CCG to manage recordings and
minutes can do the following. A scribe-bot will show up in the main #ccg IRC
channel automatically.

1. Make sure to select "Start Recording" at the beginning of the call and "Stop
   Recording" when you're done.
2. Make sure to kick everyone out of the room when the meeting is done.
3. Once the last person leaves, everything else is automated (publishing raw IRC
   log, audio, and video). If you want to clean up the minutes, it takes about
   5-10 minutes to clean up the transcription and publish it.

## [Open API Specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/)

The spec contains documentation on use cases as well are required and optional API operations.

## Reference Implementation

In order to simplify the creation of test vectors for the spec, we intend to provide a reference implementation.

This implementation will cover all required AND optional APIs and will be used to ensure no breaking changes are accidentaly contributed to the spec.

## Postman Interoperability Test Suite

In order to ensure interoperability tests are conducted in a manner consistent with production environments, we will be maintaining postman collections and client credential configuration in github actons.

This will allow us to test implementations in production with the appropriate security and authorizaton policies in place.
