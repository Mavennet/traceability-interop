    - Call Notes (1 minute)

      - These minutes and an audio recording of everything said on this call are archived at https://w3c-ccg.github.io/meetings/

      - We use Jitsi text chat to queue speakers during the call as well as to take minutes.

      - All attendees should type “present+” to get your name on the attendee list in the transcript.

      - In IRC type “q+” to add yourself to the queue, with an optional reminder, e.g., “q+ to mention something”. The “to” is required.

      - If you’re not on chat, simply ask to be put on the queue.

      - Please be brief so the rest of the queue get a chance to chime in. You can always q+ again.

      - NOTE: This meeting is held by voice, not by text. Off-topic text comments are subject to deletion from the record. We work hard to manage a single thread of conversation so everyone can participate and be heard. Please respect the group process by joining the queue when you have something to contribute.

   - Scribe Selection (2 minutes) - We need a volunteer to scribe.
